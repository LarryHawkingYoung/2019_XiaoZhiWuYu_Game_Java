# 2019_XiaoZhiWuYu_Game_Java
When I have just learned JAVA in 2019                                    
The final assignment of the course is making a game                              
This game is inspired by the ninja comic Naruto                               
Not finished completely                                                
But can be run to show the full functions and played with 2 in 11 roles in Akatsuki                                  
Really interesting with explosive BGM for each role                                              
I am really proud of it since it has cost so much of my time,                               
that I was even just one step to fail another course that semester                               
Even though it is a little bit naive, it is state-of-art for me.                                 
                                                  
Maybe years later                                   
When I play this game again                                   
I will say,                                                 
Look !
What the heck is that ?!
How stupid it is ?! though                                         
Isn't this much more burning than Boruto ?                              
这 不 比 《博 人 传》 燃 ？
